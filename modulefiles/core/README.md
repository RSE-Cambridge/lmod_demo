# Core Modules

This part could have some generic modules in it but doesn't at present since core is intended to have so few things in it that we could probably live with implementing them each by hand. YMMV. It could just as well have a _genericModule directory like in compiler and mpi module directories...

## cosmos.common

The cosmos.common module is intended to contain READ-ONLY global variables (i.e. environment variables) that are required for the other modules to function. These are things like absolute paths to base directories etc...

## Compilers

Concrete modules of compilers should be placed here. These compiler modules will set the paths to all the compiler-y stuff and also update the MODULEPATH to create the module hierarchies.
