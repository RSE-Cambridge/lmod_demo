# lmod_test

## apps
This directory contains mock installs of apps. They are arranged in a tree of 
compiler version, app version, and (where neccessary) MPI version.
Each mock app has its own hello_[APPNAME].sh script that will be loaded
into your path via the Lmod modules. You can run this script and it will say
'hello world' plus its name and versions.

In practice, the apps directory would be automatically populated via some
build system like EasyBuild or Spack.


## modulefiles
This is where the logic for the mock LMOD demo lives.
It splits the different types of modules into 3 different classes:

* core - apps where there is no need for different compiler versions or mpi versions. This is also where the modulefiles for the *actual* compilers live.
* compiler - apps that are compiled with different versions of themselves and different compilers.
* mpi - apps that are compiled with different versions of themselves, compiler, and mpi library.

There are further readmes further in the modulefiles directory tree that 
explain how these are easily implemented and extended using lmod's generic
modulefiles and symlink hackery.
